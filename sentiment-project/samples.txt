SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TEST SAMPLES


--- 🌧️ DEPRESSIVE SENTIMENT SAMPLES ---
These samples express low mood or loneliness. The model is now calibrated to detect these 'soft' markers.

1. I feel so lonely and everything seems so dark today.
2. I just want to stay in bed all day and cry, I have no energy.
3. Everything feels hopeless lately and I can't find any joy in my hobbies.
4. I'm feeling really empty and disconnected from everyone around me.
5. It's getting harder and harder to put on a brave face every morning.

--- ☀️ NON-DEPRESSIVE SENTIMENT SAMPLES ---
These samples are positive or neutral everyday statements.

1. I am so happy today, the sun is finally shining!
2. I had a great time at the park with my friends and family.
3. Learning how to code this sentiment analyzer has been a fun challenge.
4. Just finished a good book and feeling very relaxed.
5. It's a normal day at work, looking forward to the weekend.
